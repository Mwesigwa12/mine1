    <p>Me myself and personality traits when asked to describe about myself i never know what to say,but ishould know about my self the best. I look at myself as a thoughtful and a person who is willing to learn new ideas even though am not very fast in understanding something right away. I rarely  show about my anger or sadness much i always smile because i am optimistic about my life. i look at life as if something bad comes along, no need to dwell on it you cant take it back so just move on and improve what you did wrong</p>
